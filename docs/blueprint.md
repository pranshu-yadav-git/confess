# **App Name**: Letter Revelation

## Core Features:

- Letter Tile Display: Display 15-16 letter tiles with random rotations. Allow users to slide/drag them to reveal the letter at the bottom.
- Letter Transition: After revealing the letter, allow the user to click to transition to an open letter revealing a snippet of the text. Clicking the paper transitions to the proposal acceptance game.
- Proposal Game: Create a proposal acceptance game with 'Yes' and 'No' buttons. The 'No' button moves away from the mouse pointer and shrinks on every click. Clicking 'Yes' triggers a confetti popup with a love-themed message.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft pastel colors (e.g., light pink, baby blue) for a romantic feel.
- Secondary color: Use a neutral light gray or beige for backgrounds to emphasize the main content.
- Accent: Rose gold (#B76E79) for highlights, buttons, and interactive elements.
- Ensure a clean, centered layout with sufficient spacing for easy readability and interaction.
- Use smooth, gentle transitions and animations for revealing content and button movements.
- Incorporate heart and love-themed icons subtly throughout the UI.

## Original User Request:
create a web app with html, css and js, and any plugins you say, it has to be realistic, 15-16 letters stacked up no-name on them, all are centered at first, but random rotations, after sliding through them, by dragging them aside, finally at bottom, should reveal the letter, after clicking on it, should smoothly transition into an open letter and then it should reveal the actual text written on paper, not full, just a little bit of the text, on clicking the paper, it should then transition into the game, in which, there is a text - "I love you, will you accept my proposal? Please..." with two buttons "Yes üòç" with green background, and "No üôÑ" with a red background, but, you shouldnt be able to click it, when mouse pointer reaches it, it should move away, if the user finds a hack, and clicks on the no button, it should scale to be just a little bit smaller than before and become smaller on every click, also, should display cute messages if she clicks no,
if she clicks yes, there should be a popup, with confetti in background, with text - "Love You Pookie üéÄüíù" in a love-theme font
